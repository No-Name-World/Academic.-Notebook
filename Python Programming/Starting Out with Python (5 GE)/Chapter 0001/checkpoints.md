### 1.1 What is a program?
A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task. It is a sequence of instructions that are executed by the computer to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.


### 1.2 What is hardware?
Hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. It includes all the tangible components of a computer system such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, motherboard, CPU, hard disk, and other peripheral devices.


### 1.3 List the five major components of a computer system.
The five major components of a computer system are Input devices, Output devices, Secondary storage devices, Main Memory, and CPU. Input devices are used to input data into the computer, output devices are used to display or output data from the computer, secondary storage devices are used to store data for long periods of time, main memory is used to store data and programs temporarily while the computer is running, and the CPU is responsible for executing instructions and controlling the operation of the computer.


### 1.4 What part of the computer actually runs programs?
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of the computer that actually runs programs. It is responsible for executing instructions and controlling the operation of the computer.


### 1.5 What part of the computer serves as a work area to store a program and its data while the program is running?
The main memory (or RAM) serves as a work area to store a program and its data while the program is running.


### 1.6 What part of the computer holds data for long periods of time, even when there is no power to the computer?
The secondary storage devices (such as hard disks, SSDs, and other non-volatile memory) hold data for long periods of time, even when there is no power to the computer.


### 1.7 What part of the computer collects data from people and from other devices?
Input devices collect data from people and from other devices.


### 1.8 What part of the computer formats and presents data for people or other devices?
Output devices format and present data for people or other devices.


### 1.9 What fundamental set of programs control the internal operations of the computer’s hardware?
The operating system is the fundamental set of programs that control the internal operations of the computer’s hardware.


### 1.10 What do you call a program that performs a specialized task, such as a virus scanner, a file compression program, or a data backup program?
A program that performs a specialized task is called a utility program.


### 1.11 Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, email programs, web browsers, and game programs belong to what category of software?
Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, email programs, web browsers, and game programs belong to the category of application software.


### 1.12 What amount of memory is enough to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number?
A single byte of memory is enough to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number.


### 1.13 What do you call a tiny “switch” that can be set to either on or off?
A tiny “switch” that can be set to either on or off is called a bit.


### 1.14 In what numbering system are all numeric values written as sequences of 0s and 1s?
All numeric values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s in the binary numbering system.


### 1.15 What is the purpose of ASCII?
The purpose of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is to represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices that use text. It is an encoding scheme that uses a set of 128 numeric codes to represent English letters, various punctuation marks, and other characters. These numeric codes are used to store characters in a computer’s memory. (ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.)


### 1.16 What encoding scheme is extensive enough to represent the characters of many of the languages in the world?
The encoding scheme that is extensive enough to represent the characters of many of the languages in the world is Unicode.


### 1.17 What do the terms “digital data” and “digital device” mean?
“Digital data” refers to data that is represented in a discrete, binary format (0s and 1s), while a “digital device” is any device that processes or uses digital data, such as computers, smartphones, and digital cameras.
